config for zsh

This is my first attemt at a config for the zshell, or any shell for that matter. I currently have code from other dotfiles that I found over github, but eventually I'll have personal configs.

#############################
## .zshrc ###################
#############################
Runs through all folders and sub-folders 1 level down in the dotfiles directory and sources any file that ends in .zsh. 


#############################
## aliases.zsh ##############
#############################
zshcon = Launches ~/.zshrc for changes (gedit)
reload! = Reloads the shell with having to exit out of the terminal
install = shorthand for 'sudo apt-get install '
update = shorthand for 'sudo apt-get update'
