config for zsh

This is my first attempt at a config for the zshell, or any shell for that matter. I currently have code from other dotfiles that I found over github, but eventually I'll have personal configs.

#############################
## .zshrc ###################
#############################
Runs through all folders and sub-folders 1 level down in the dotfiles directory and sources any file that ends in .zsh.
